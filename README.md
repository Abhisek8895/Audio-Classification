UrbanSound8K Audio Classification
This project classifies urban sounds into 10 categories using the UrbanSound8K dataset. We extract Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) features from audio files and train a Sequential neural network using TensorFlow/Keras. The trained model is saved in .keras format and deployed using a Flask API. To use the project, clone the repository, install the dependencies, and run the Flask app to predict audio classes from uploaded audio files. Detailed instructions and code are provided in the repository.
